A demo of my website www.bakanini.com (Currently only show properly in Firefox. Opening it in Chrome/ Safari would cause z-fighting issue.)

The 3D scence can be explored by mouse, such as pan, zoom in/out, hover and click.

Features to be improved in the future:
1. The Lookat of the camera and mouse events;
2. Lighting;
3. Add a main menu;
4. Add landing pages for more contents;
5. Add help texts for better interaction with the scene;
6. Organize the src files.



The website is built by simple React and three.js. All 3d contents are not shown in this repo as their sizes are too big to upload.
